\chapter*{Preface}

The main text, on complex manifolds, was the notes from a course with the same title given at UCLA in the fall of 1966. It was written up after each lecture; only minor changes have been made. To the Department of Mathematics at UCLA, and Lowell Paige in particular, I wish to express here my belated thanks. The Appendix was an expanded version of a series of lectures given at a summer seminar of the Canadian Mathematical Congress taken place in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1971. I wish to thank Professor J. R. Vanstone for his hospitality and kindness. Noteworthy is the treatment of the secondary characteristic classes, which is different from the one given in [19] in the Bibliography to the Appendix.

Needless to say, my deepest gratitude is to the University of California at Berkeley and the National Science Foundation for their continuous support of my research.
